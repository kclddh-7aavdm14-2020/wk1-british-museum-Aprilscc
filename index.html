        <p>The British Museum, which was established in 1753, is one of the biggest museum in the world. Initially, the collections there was donated by Sir Hans Sloane, who was a famous private collector at that time and donated nearly 80000 personal collections to the country according to his will. And finally it was established by the Act of Parliament in 7th June, 1753. The objects were extended by the King George VI, bringing the Kingâ€™s Library to the museum. And later, archaeologists began to actively take part in archaeological excavations oversea. Thus, Assyria cultural relics, cuneiform were preserved. And the collections were enriched by the colonization, war trophies</p>
        <p>Thus the British Museum has treasures from across the world. This week we focused on the Egyptian gallery. I found that the gallery was named Egyptian death and afterlife: mummies. As its name suggested, the gallery has mummies, coffins, funerary masks, etc. These items were buried with the deceased, so exploring there antique definitely can help us know more about how ancient Egyptians viewed on death, and their funerial cultural. And there is no doubt that the collections are very fascinating, mummies are always regarded as something really mysterious and have magic. So, from my point of view, I want to know more about why mummies are made, and why it can be preserved so well, as well as the history stories behind it, if it has. And what expectations or emotions they convey through the exhibition, such as the Book of the Dead of Hunefer.</p>
        <p>From the introduction of the gallery fact, medical CT scanners are used to explore the mummies, and the collections also make contributions to the research in not only archaeology, but also human biology, anatomy, historical diseases. Because known from the website, most internal organs were removed. So I believe these antiques have both ornamental value and research value. And actually I found third-party platform is used in the website. The google Street View is used when taking a VR tour, and I think it is very useful. Since the key purpose to visit a museum is to observe the exhibits carefully, Google Street View helps us like we are at the British museum in person, showing a detailed and clearly picture of the collections themselves. But sometimes literal explanations besides the antiques are not very clear, probably those characters are too small. </p>
        <p>Finally, in my opinion, I believe the museum was managed by a combination of government, volunteers and the researchers. There are so many antiques in the British Museum that it is said the collections exhibited only account account for 1%. And the antiques are so precious that they need professional workers to repair it and to preserve it. Besides, because of the great value, best security systems and maybe professional security guards are need to take good care of the treasures. All of these need huge amount of money I guess, and government should pay a lot in this part. </p>
